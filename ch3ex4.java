//Chapter 3 Exercise 4. The object of the program is to print from 1 to 100. I chose to use a for loop.

public class ch3ex4{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		for ( int x =1; x <=100; x++ ) // use x++ post-fix so value is given first then it is incremented.
			System.out.println(x);
	}
}
